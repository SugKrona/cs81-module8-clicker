### What helped you understand DOM interaction best?

Just going back and forth and testing the code helped the most, seeing the actual clickfeed and then doing fine tunning for the desired outcome was helping. 

### How did you choose your milestone messages?

I just used the suggested milestone messages but I added a few extra after 100 for anyone who wanted to keep on clicking.

### What challenge or bug surprised you?

The best bug I encountered was pretty good, it was related to one of the things I added, which was the cookie button. I had it grow every milestone but after it hit the 100 milestone it somehow grew exponentially large where even if I zoomed out all the way i couldnt even have a 1/4 of the cookie in view.  

### What personal twist did you add?

I used the Cookie emoji as the button, and since i really liked how the emoji looked I decided to focus on the twist revolving around it. I had the cookie shake and grow every milestone. After the 100 milestone the cookie can grow a few more times but its growth is capped at 200 clicks, however you can still keep clicking and the cookie will shake and given an updated count message for every 50 clicks. 


### What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?

There are several real-world uses for this type of interaction, off the top of my head I can think of it being used in a simple game keeping track of clicks or requiring constabt clicks to perform/maintain an action in game. Secondly I know something like this is definetly used in TikTok livestreams where users tap the screen/click thier mouse in the stream in increase liked and increase the chances of the broadcaster to be featured.
